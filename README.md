# Risk of Diabetic Ketoacidosis Causing Hospital Readmission

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of hospital readmission among patients with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA). Using machine learning models, we aim to identify high-risk patients and improve ICU resource allocation.

## Files we used:
- `lightGBM_ver02.ipynb`: The notebook used grid search on LightGBM to compare combinations of different NaN Filling Methods and Class Imbalance Handling Techniques, then used metrics including Precision, Recall,	F1-Score, and	ROC-AUC to evaluate the results. After getting the ideal hyperparameters, figures of the ROC-AUC graph, calibration curve and feature importance score are drawn according to the final model for further analysis in the report.
